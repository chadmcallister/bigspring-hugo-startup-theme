An electronic marketplace for bullion, precious and industrial metals can be set up within weeks or even days. In addition to a dynamically priced catalog feature, the order-matching feature allows all market participants to engage in product-focused transactions.

### Authenticity and product validation

Provide trust and privacy throughout the supply chain with product validation and tamper-evident packaging.

### How it works

Customers, traders, suppliers and vendors (“participants”) can participate in the marketplace by opening an account on the secure website portal. Participants can then offer physical products to sell and the sale price, or products they wish to purchase and bid the price they want to pay. The software matches the buy and sell orders, notifies the buyer and seller of a transaction, handles the payment, shipping and storage of the product.

Participants can access the website 24/7 and all activities are self-directed. There are no intermediaries to negotiate pricing or finalize transactions and participants can change their offered or bid prices at any time prior to a match. All buy and sell transactions are anonymous. Therefore, all participants can instantaneously see offered prices and bids for products on the website but they will not know the source and can be assured of privacy.
