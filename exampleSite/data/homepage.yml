    - "/images/undraw_in_progress_ql66.svg"
    content: System verified, self-directed participants begin by opening an account
      in the secure website portal. Participants then select products to sell and
      the sale price, or products to purchase and bid the price.  The software matches
      the buy and sell orders, notifies the buyer and seller of a transaction, keeping
      participants anonymous from each other.  <br><br>The operator and/or trusted
      expert partners use the platform to manage operational activities including
      the payment, product authentication, packaging, storage, and shipping processes.
      The operational efficiencies and excellence enabled by the OrderMatch™ software
      platform accelerates growth and expansion of a highly scalable marketplace.
