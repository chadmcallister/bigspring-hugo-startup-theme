    content: Olefins include ethylene, propylene and butadiene, the raw materials
      for many plastics. Multiple manufacturers make and store these raw materials.
      Plastic manufacturers employ traders to bid for the raw materials and arrange
      shipping or storage. OrderMatchTM software can provide a marketplace allowing
      olefin manufacturers to enter prices and plastic manufacturers to enter bids
      to buy. The software conducts a transaction when the buy and sell price match.
      Shipping, storage and payment is arranged by the administrative functions of
      the software. Credit qualifications for buyers can be entered and hold or release
      functions set. The software can handle any size buyer or seller and any size
      transaction, even if multiple orders to one buyer or seller. Buyers and sellers
      are anonymous to each other. The software provides a more efficient platform
      for traders and in some cases customers and manufacturers can conduct self-directed
      transactions without intermediaries.
