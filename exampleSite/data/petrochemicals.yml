    content: Olefins include ethylene, propylene and butadiene, the raw materials
      for many plastics. Multiple manufacturers make and store these raw materials.
      Plastic manufacturers employ traders to bid for the raw materials and arrange
      shipping or storage. OrderMatch™ software can provide a marketplace allowing
      olefin manufacturers to enter prices and plastic manufacturers to enter bids
      to buy. The software conducts a transaction when the buy and sell price match.
      Shipping, storage and payment is arranged by the administrative functions of
      the software. Credit qualifications for buyers can be entered and hold or release
      functions set. The software can handle any size buyer or seller and any size
      transaction, even if multiple orders to one buyer or seller. Buyers and sellers
      are anonymous to each other. The software provides a more efficient platform
      for traders and in some cases customers and manufacturers can conduct self-directed
      transactions without intermediaries.

    content: Aromatics include benzene, toluene, and xylene which are raw materials
      for making dyes, synthetic detergents, polystyrene and epoxy resins. Buy and
      sell function capabilities and order matching for aromatics is like the capabilities
      for olefins. In an international market many regulations affect shipping and
      storage. OrderMatch™ software has the capability to monitor these regulations
      and authenticate product. It also has the capability to track the shipping cargo
      containing the products.

    - "/images/undraw_two_factor_authentication_namy.svg"
    content: Olefins are made into resin pellets by plastic manufacturers for sale
      to downstream consumer product manufacturers. OrderMatchTM software allows resin
      buyers and sellers to list product by density, catalyst used for manufacture,
      and other specifications relevant for the manufacture of end-products such as
      milk bottles, film, and automobile parts. Sellers list the price for each product,
      buyers bid a price and the software conducts a transaction when the prices match.
      Buyers and sellers are anonymous to each other, eliminating competitive collusion.
      The website shows offerings 24/7 and allows transactions to be self-directed.
      Authentication can be included in operations and shipping, storage, and payment
      functions operate with minimal administrative oversight.
