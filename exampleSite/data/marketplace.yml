    content: System verified, self-directed participants begin by opening an account
      in the secure website portal. Participants then select products to sell and
      the sale price, or products to purchase and bid the price.  The software matches
      the buy and sell orders, notifies the buyer and seller of a transaction, keeping
      participants anonymous from each other.  The operator and/or trusted operational
      partners with expertise in a specific industry area use the platform to manage
      operational activities including the payment, product authentication, packaging,
      storage, and shipping processes. The operational efficiencies and excellence
      enabled by the OrderMatch platform accelerates growth and expansion of a highly
      scalable marketplace.
