      Pricing, shipping, and margins can be facilitated by the software. Administration of invoices and supply chain management can be handled by fewer employees.

      Production and sales sometimes require specialized equipment or packaging that is not easily accessible or affordable for all volume of producers. OrderMatch Universe™ business model can build an electronic marketplace for purchase, rental and cooperative use of equipment or for recycling of packaging and other supplies.
