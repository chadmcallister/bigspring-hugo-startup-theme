    content: Whole blood, platelets, plasma, red and white blood cells, and bone marrow
      have a defined shelf life, but their need is often immediate to solve a medical
      crisis. Hosting a website using OrderMatchTM software can create a database
      whereby participants can locate rare blood types and access sources of these
      products. In addition, suppliers of specialized transfusion and blood processing
      equipment can participate to make their products readily available.
