    content: Whole blood, platelets, plasma, red and white blood cells, and bone marrow
      have a defined shelf life, but their need is often immediate to solve a medical
      crisis. Hosting a website using OrderMatchâ„¢ software can create a database whereby
      participants can locate rare blood types and access sources of these products.
      In addition, suppliers of specialized transfusion and blood processing equipment
      can participate to make their products readily available.

    content: The disparity in regulations controlling the sale and distribution of
      legal hemp and cannabis products across the United States has caused significant
      challenges for these startup businesses to get their products to market. Even
      though there are potential investors, access to customers, arranging shipping
      and distribution, and authentication of product continue to challenge this industry.
      The OrdermatchTM software and OrderMatch UniverseTM business model provide a
      marketplace where customers can locate products to buy, and sellers can determine
      regulations for various shipping locations. Authentication can be added to the
      operation and administration is handled by the software for cost effective operation.

    content: In the healthcare industry, both specialized and commodity equipment
      and supplies can experience periods of shortages. In addition, oversupply may
      occur at individual facilities. The OrderMatchTM software serves as a marketplace
      where medical facilities of all sizes can locate, buy and sell products with
      other participants on a website. The recent pandemic-related need for PPE and
      other supplies demonstrates the need for an easy to access marketplace.
